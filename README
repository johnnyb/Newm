This is Newm.  Eventually it will be an Objective-C implementation of at least part of Ruby-on-Rails

To build on OSX, go into the src directory and issue the following command:

gcc -Wall *.m -framework Foundation

run by doing ./a.out

Currently runs as a CGI program, so you can export PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING to test
