= Newm

This is Newm.  Eventually it will be an Objective-C implementation of at least part of Ruby-on-Rails

To build on OSX, go into the src directory and issue the following command:

gcc -Wall *.m -framework Foundation

Currently runs as a CGI program, so you can export PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING to test

To get the test application to run, do:

  cd src
  make

  export PATH_INFO=bbb/myAction3
  build/newmapp
