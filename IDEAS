* Need to separate out NMAbstractRequest into a protocol and an object

* It would be cool to have a function to auto-detect if a file had changed, and then run a rebuild script which rebuilt and relaunched the app

* Controllers can be re-used

* Views can be re-used

* Conventions:
  * View Name: NewmView_view_controllername_actionname_format
  * Layout Name: NewmView_layout_controllername_format

* Controllers that define additional view data fields need to override reset and set them to nil between requests.  But this needs to call [super reset] as well.
